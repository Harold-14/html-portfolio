<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Harold, I'm 19 years old, and I consider myself charming, disciplined, and full of determination. 
  Originally from Laos, I take pride in my roots, 
  but I’ve also had the chance to travel to many countries, which allowed me to discover different cultures and open my mind to the world. 
  Being very sociable, I enjoy meeting new people and engaging in conversations.</p>

<p>Always seeking personal growth, I love learning and setting new goals. Whether in my studies or daily life, 
  I make it a point to move forward methodically and with determination. 
  My hardworking and ambitious nature drives me to constantly improve, while setting my priorities clearly to reach my life goals.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm looking for a girlfriend to share my journey with. My ideal type is blonde,
   and I’m searching for someone with whom I can grow and continue building a successful future together.</p>
